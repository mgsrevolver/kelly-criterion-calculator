# Kelly Criterion Calculator

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About the Kelly Criterion

The Kelly Criterion is a mathematical formula that helps you determine the optimal bet size for a given wager, based on the size of your bankroll and the expected return on investment. This app uses the Kelly Criterion to calculate the optimal bet size for a given wager, and shows you how those optimal bets can compound over time.

## How the Program Works

To use the app, start by entering your starting bankroll, the odds of your chosen wager, the expected probability of success, and the number of total bets. The app will then calculate the optimal bet size based on the Kelly Criterion and show you how much you should wager to maximize your expected return.

As you place more bets and your bankroll grows or shrinks, you can continue to use the Kelly Criterion to calculate the optimal bet size for each wager. The app will update in real-time to show you how those optimal bets compound over time, giving you a clear sense of how your bankroll can grow over time with sound bet sizing.
